blackfriday
Just watched a video of people charging around like animals in Tesco for #BlackFriday. Seriously?
All these offers for #BlackFriday and I can't get in any websites ??
A lot harder to get up this morning than I thought it was gonna be #BlackFriday
Irresponsible UK Supermarkets! Won't be long before someone is killed? #BlackFriday - http://t.co/tcqOshI2iA
Via @MeteorologistPC: Sunny and mild conditions in the forecast today  #BlackFriday http://t.co/qOwgFu46gh

As if there's a queue to get onto the curry's website!? #blackfriday
#BlackFriday is basically looting that you have to pay for
After investigating deals online, I've come to the conclusion that #BlackFriday is for the Gullible.
This @JumiaNigeria #BlackFriday is shit! you can't even click BUY NOW! the next thing you'll see is SOLD OUT!
Stop buying things you don't need. They'll be worth nothing in 3 years. #BlackFriday
Dreading work / town today #BlackFriday #yousetoflocusts #stupidamericanshit
This #BlackFriday thing is madness. Shoppers are fighting everywhere. #crazy
Riot at clapham junction fooklocker #blackfriday lol
I don't go shopping on #BlackFriday. I've seen what happens e.g. too crowded, people fighting which ends in hospital visits and cops called.
8 hours done.... only 4 more to go #BlackFriday #ILoveMyJob #INeedABeer #Or6
I once had to abandon my mother and aunt in Maceys on #BlackFriday coz I just couldn't deal. It's like shopping as a blood sport.
America is leaking again. #blackfriday
@ASOS Oh that's right. Because it's all a massive con to make us panic buy. I forgot. #blackfriday
Its seems that fighting over bargains seems to be common place now. Legitimate riot/ loot? #BlackFriday   http://t.co/XhlCxovj4o
Queuing to shop online ?? #BlackFriday
You see, in the UK #BlackFriday was when #Thatcher and her mob f&amp; £ed up the economy - 16% interest rates
Food poisoning bug found in 70% of Asda's chicken. On the bright side, it's #BlackFriday, and they are 70% off... #asdablackfriday
I don't wanna see any tweets/status about #BlackFriday shopping happening before 12am, yall crazies are the reason I'm up at 3am #salty
Don't be fooled into spending money just because it is #BlackFriday . If you had not budgeted for it, then it is definitely not worth it.
I refuse to go anywhere near town in the next couple days. #Amazoniswhereitsat #BlackFriday
It appears @AmazonUK is struggling to cope today #blackfriday http://t.co/fMTj2kQJIj
Oh yeah it's #BlackFriday and people are loopy! Fighting in shops over material things that are mass produced but for cheap..... Yeah.......
56 minutes in a queue just to get on the website! Unreal!?? #BlackFriday http://t.co/GfP0plsRbm
Have reserved items at @Argos_Online to pick up in store, scared I might get punched or something!!! #BlackFriday
Why is black Friday in England now? It's the first shopping day after thanksgiving, the American tradition we don't have! Stop #BlackFriday
The amount of traffic shopping online is way too enormous ??. Some sites r crashing already! wtf! #BlackFriday
Drowning myself in debt.... some more. #BlackFriday #cryinginside
The kind of scenes witnessed on #BlackFriday make me sick. Everything's that's wrong with today's society summed up in 2 words.
It just takes that one rude customer to ruin your shift. #BlackFriday
Black Friday Weekend doesn't even make any sense!!!! #BlackFriday
Why isn't #BlackFriday the deals offering me the things i need!!!
And then hell began... #blackfriday
Not looking forward to work today?? #BlackFriday
Watch as Americans head to the front of shitty stores to purchase pure shit in order to fill their empty souls. #BlackFriday
This #BlackFriday rubbish websites not working mini rioting over a pseudo bargain and people getting angry over shit they dont actually need
After watching the videos of #BlackFriday from various supermarkets around the nation, I can honestly say I'm ashamed of this country.
Disappointed that Apple didn't drop their prices today unlike #BlackFriday last year ??
#NotOneDime #BlackFriday ??MT .@LouisFarrakhan: Why shld we continue to spend our money when we are deprived of justice? #BlackOutBlackFriday
Proof how much we get ripped off the other 364 days! #BlackFriday
Can't get on any websites that have anything to do with #BlackFriday it's mental!
Save a life, possibly your own. Stay home this #BlackFriday!
Waking up so early to go be part of this #BlackFriday mess. Totally against my will!! ??
At least two people arrested at #BlackFriday sales events already this morning. Keep calm people!
I'm beginning to wonder how many people know what Black Friday actually is without looking it up on Google  #BlackFriday
Up at 5:30 so that I can be at work before 7 so crazy people can start shopping at the crack of dawn #blackfriday
#BlackFriday Where capitalism and greed is shown in all its finest glory.
Let's not forget what #BlackFriday is all about. The day when so many tragically got lost in a shopping mall and never came out again.
I think every email I have deleted this morning has been about #BlackFriday. It's not a public holiday in the UK. Stop it now!
All these people (in the UK) that are in the shops on #BlackFriday ..erm...do they not have a job to go to? #justsaying
Woman arrested for fighting over purchasing 12 coffee machines...Remember It's only a deal if you actually want the thing... #BlackFriday
#BlackFriday is ridiculous.  #JustSayin' (-; ~ have at it you vultures, LOL
Can't think of anything worse than partaking in #BlackFriday .... another 'americanism' I'd rather was left t'other side of Pond #crazy
#BlackFriday is the reason the world calls us ugly Americans. Going to work at 4am. Yay.
Shame people can't buy a personality #BlackFriday
I'm pissed! Love won't go to sleep bc she scared so I'm up like I'm #BlackFriday shopping ????
Sadly thanksgiving is over, now it's time to get crazy for #BlackFriday :p
I wonder how many people actually NEEDED what they queued &amp; wrestled for in the #blackfriday sales &amp; how many just didn't want to miss out!
What the fuck. People FIGHTING over tv's and ipads at Tesco in Craigavon #BlackFridayCraziness #BlackFriday
Unbelievable the amount of people desperate for a few quid off end of line stock #BlackFriday
There was me thinking #BlackFriday was the last Fri before Xmas where everyone gets drunk and fights   people really queuing.....at shops!!
It's almost 2 am and I want to run out of here. #BlackFriday
Absolutely terrified to go anywhere near Silverburn today nevermind working a 2-9 shift ???? #BlackFriday #Madness #Help
Due to the residents' dependence on bottled water, Waitrose runs Wimbledon now. Ocado delivers in armored trucks. #BlackFriday
Stuck in traffic trying to get into town, all the bargains are going to have gone ?? #BlackFriday
Am I really about to brave the @traffordcentre on #BlackFriday - I must be mad!!
I'm not having anything to do with #blackfriday.  Shops are turning us into vulgar human beings.
#BlackFriday well well! Not my favourite colour. Try Green.
Have to work 5:30 am to noon #blackfriday #insanepeopledothis
Never occurred to me what day me and mum agreed to go Christmas shopping on until now... Today is going to be chaos! #blackfriday
Seeing some crazy footage of #BlackFriday :/ people are so greedy. Not in the spirit of Christmas at all ??
#BlackFriday is something I will defiantly NOT be participating in thank you very much... I'm happy with my telly lol
#BlackFriday is a day where you save money by wasting money on stuff you didn't need on Thursday. Great Corporate exploitation
Just caved in someone's head with a toaster to get the last jelly beans. #blackfriday
I'm tired and emotional, fuck yeah! - @AntonioPulsoni #blackfriday
.@EdLoach @VanessaMoon9 we are suckers for the impulse to conform (do it because everyone else does) #BlackFriday ....
Just seen a fat middle aged guy drop kick a telly out a pensioners hands then snatched it to the counter and bought it #BlackFriday
Am I the only one that doesn't give a $hit about #BlackFriday
I heard #roykeane fancied a scrap at the local Tesco over discounted Just for men products rather than go to Villa training. #BlackFriday
Put your prices up by 10% then have a extra 5% off sale #BlackFriday
Here we go... People thinking they're saving money by spending it #BlackFriday
