Let's not forget what #BlackFriday is all about. The day when so many tragically got lost in a shopping mall and never came out again.
What’s going on Apple? Allowing things like keyboard shortcuts not syncing, apps not syncing &amp; handoff not working at all.. #apple #ios8

Getting through to apple takes far too long
Currently waiting for the Internet recovery to complete on my mac while still on the line to Apple care.
#BlackFriday I don't hate the deals, I hate the fact we think we can do it in Britain....
