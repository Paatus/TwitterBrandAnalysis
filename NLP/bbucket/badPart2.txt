Why is black Friday in England now? It's the first shopping day after thanksgiving, the American tradition we don't have! Stop #BlackFriday
Dear, Apple. Make a charger that can actually do its job and last for more than 2 months.  Thanks!

After watching the videos of #BlackFriday from various supermarkets around the nation, I can honestly say I'm ashamed of this country.
Heard on news: "stores shld wait til Fri to open, takes from fam time." THEN GO THE FUCK HOME IDIOT. I detest #BlackFriday. #retailproblems
People know the price of everything and the value of nothing...  #BlackFriday
