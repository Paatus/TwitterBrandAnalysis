#BlackFriday part one: avoiding bass pro lines with mom by waiting in line at Starbucks instead.
#BlackFriday Sad to see the videos of so many people losing their dignity as they fight over a TV. It'd be ironic if the TV's were broken
Most tech products on #BlackFriday will be items that will drop in price rapidly anyway, how much is that 50 inch 3D TV really worth?

@GaryFallon2 this is a shitty ikea fold out "sleep with your head out cos we're too cheap for that much foam" deal. But you win.
#BlackFriday madness!
Hint #2 for McDonalds: Your own workers can't afford to eat at you restaurants.

Let's not forget what #BlackFriday is all about. The day when so many tragically got lost in a shopping mall and never came out again.
What’s going on Apple? Allowing things like keyboard shortcuts not syncing, apps not syncing &amp; handoff not working at all.. #apple #ios8
People buying things they don't need with money they don't own #BlackFriday #Sales #Commercialism #ZombieSpenders

Never drink apple cider before bed. Especially fermented and very sour. Weeeiiiird dreams.
@_ltsryan_ @sydnayynay @McDonalds Lol no thx. I like chicken that doesn't have bleach in it XD
@KuuTenko I think the fault is Nintendo having region locking personally.
Dear Kenyans, its Christmas and everyone's looking for cash. So before you remove that expensive Samsung  s5, look out for muggers around.
I swear I'm on a mission to lose this damn iPhone
Getting through to apple takes far too long
Currently waiting for the Internet recovery to complete on my mac while still on the line to Apple care.
#BlackFriday I don't hate the deals, I hate the fact we think we can do it in Britain....
@oleivarrudi @rain_games Has that been google translated because it really doesn't make much sense...Am I the only one confused?
@MichaelCondrey I bought the season pass on my 360. And why I can't get the AE4 on my Xbox one?
After investigating deals online, I've come to the conclusion that #BlackFriday is for the Gullible.
@julietLyi You and I   Are going to have to sit down after the 16th   And have a talk about why Apple devices are figuratively shit
There are people starving in the world.. And then there's people fighting in asda over fucking TV's!! Get a grip people #BlackFriday

@nytimes It’s Spain. But it doesn’t mean Google is the white page for our news. In ME there’re a lot of issues Google reads them reversely..
@PowersThatBeat Thanks, but I'm boycotting apple in all it's shades of grey. A personal thing. That includes iTunes.
How can people even work with Android.
@JennieGow @McLarenF1 Nice chairs. Expect an Ikea copycat design by the end of the month

Ahh #BlackFriday - the time of year we get all excited because the shops are selling things at the price we should be paying all the time...
Almost 10 hours into #BlackFriday and still can't get into the @Tesco website - very poor indeed
The queues for shops are insane. Staying well away!... #BlackFriday

@MAAInsiders There are a lot of talks among the community saying Playdom/Disney are pulling the plug on the game soon, is that true?
@Supernova_tash no. Which is why he left Nike. Once he creates the product they determine price based on hype and materials &amp; release dates
What the fuck. People FIGHTING over tv's and ipads at Tesco in Craigavon #BlackFridayCraziness #BlackFriday
I wonder how many people actually NEEDED what they queued &amp; wrestled for in the #blackfriday sales &amp; how many just didn't want to miss out!
