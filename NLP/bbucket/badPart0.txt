@oleivarrudi @rain_games Has that been google translated because it really doesn't make much sense...Am I the only one confused?
@MichaelCondrey I bought the season pass on my 360. And why I can't get the AE4 on my Xbox one?
After investigating deals online, I've come to the conclusion that #BlackFriday is for the Gullible.
@julietLyi You and I   Are going to have to sit down after the 16th   And have a talk about why Apple devices are figuratively shit
There are people starving in the world.. And then there's people fighting in asda over fucking TV's!! Get a grip people #BlackFriday
After all the content on Google is posted by people, so you can't say EVERYTHING you find there is gospel truth or fair comment
@XboxSupport The email associated with my account doesn't exist, and I can't login to my xbox account. I get error code: 8015D002
.@gillian_ELLE just had to look up Bonnie Tyler on google. What do they teach kids in school these days? https://t.co/76F4bvLrGv
Fuck why did I leave the iPad in the car?!
Feel like I'm missing out on good deals on everything!  #BlackFriday
@nytimes It’s Spain. But it doesn’t mean Google is the white page for our news. In ME there’re a lot of issues Google reads them reversely..
@PowersThatBeat Thanks, but I'm boycotting apple in all it's shades of grey. A personal thing. That includes iTunes.
How can people even work with Android.
@JennieGow @McLarenF1 Nice chairs. Expect an Ikea copycat design by the end of the month
I had Starbucks yesterday and I ordered a latte but I didn't know it was coffee and it was the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth
@SiilanPie @PlayStation idk what ur talking about i never had a chance to play with consoles even now.This was my neigbours
Ahh #BlackFriday - the time of year we get all excited because the shops are selling things at the price we should be paying all the time...
Almost 10 hours into #BlackFriday and still can't get into the @Tesco website - very poor indeed
The queues for shops are insane. Staying well away!... #BlackFriday
@mimethedj couldn't use rumbletalk :( pls can u try chatwing? they have mobile apps so listeners can chat on their android or ios devices
@MAAInsiders There are a lot of talks among the community saying Playdom/Disney are pulling the plug on the game soon, is that true?
@Supernova_tash no. Which is why he left Nike. Once he creates the product they determine price based on hype and materials &amp; release dates
What the fuck. People FIGHTING over tv's and ipads at Tesco in Craigavon #BlackFridayCraziness #BlackFriday
I wonder how many people actually NEEDED what they queued &amp; wrestled for in the #blackfriday sales &amp; how many just didn't want to miss out!
Apple heads to trial over digital music claims http://t.co/iFQumsTlUz

Thank you Samsung Service Center for re-programming my Tablet w/o even asking me. Smh.
For some reason I cannot update my google drive data. Trying various work arounds.
What the fuck makes people think that this kind of behaviour is acceptable? #BlackFriday #BlackFridayMadness #BatteredOverATelly #Arseholes
I'm tired and emotional, fuck yeah! - @AntonioPulsoni #blackfriday
At the MacBook hospital aka The Apple Shop ;)
I did actually want to buy a few things 2day but #BlackFriday is kind of putting me off ?? to brave it or not?
Am I really about to brave the @traffordcentre on #BlackFriday - I must be mad!!
Eww I feel a bit sick after McDs. Don't be like me kids, don't make the same mistakes I made. Say No to McDonalds and being single over 40.

Don't be fooled into spending money just because it is #BlackFriday . If you had not budgeted for it, then it is definitely not worth it.
My friends discriminate against me because I'm an Android user #BlissiPhone6 @RadioBlissJo

I'm baffled why Skype has a UI that allows me to see more of a conversation on my iPad than I can on my laptop, which is bigger
@ASOS Oh that's right. Because it's all a massive con to make us panic buy. I forgot. #blackfriday
